<h1>About Lambdatest Nova</h1>
<p align="center">
    Laravel Nova (https://nova.laravel.com) is an excellent tool to create admin interfaces having usual CRUD applications in minutes. It can be extended to add custom functionalities too. With rich documentation (https://nova.laravel.com/docs/) and a very large ecosystem there are several thousands plugins/extensions which makes writing custom functionalities very easy.<br>

    We want you to create a custom tool in Nova which shows INR v/s USD, INR v/s GBP and INR v/s EUR currency rates in small widgets in a custom page. https://nova.laravel.com/docs/3.0/customization/tools.html <br>

    You can use the API endpoint: https://api.exchangeratesapi.io/latest?base=INR to fetch the exchange rates.<br>

    Through this exercise you will get to know:
    1. How to build powerful backend interfaces quickly
    2. How Vue.js works
    3. How webpack works (to compile/build)

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
