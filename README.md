<h1>Lambdatest Nova</h1>
<h3> About Project </h3>

<p>Laravel Nova (https://nova.laravel.com) is an excellent tool to create admin interfaces having usual CRUD applications in minutes. It can be extended to add custom functionalities too. With rich documentation (https://nova.laravel.com/docs/) and a very large ecosystem there are several thousands plugins/extensions which makes writing custom functionalities very easy.</p>

<p>We want you to create a custom tool in Nova which shows INR v/s USD, INR v/s GBP and INR v/s EUR currency rates in small widgets in a custom page. https://nova.laravel.com/docs/3.0/customization/tools.html </p>

<p>You can use the API endpoint: https://api.exchangeratesapi.io/latest?base=INR to fetch the exchange rates.

Through this exercise you will get to know:
1. How to build powerful backend interfaces quickly
2. How Vue.js works
3. How webpack works (to compile/build)</p>
